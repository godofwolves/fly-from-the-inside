Shinedown is an american rock band formed in 2001 in Jacksonville Florida, yes I memorized when and where they where formed, this is an amazing band, forming in the early 2000's where rock was becoming nonexistent, we are in an age where music takes a different turn from the 20th century and rock is no longer a mainstream genre of music,though modern rock has evolved from the previous years of rock music it is still not seen much in modern light

There first album leave a whisper was released in 2003 opening the album was the name of this site, fly from the inside which was one of the singles advertized on the album with 45, this album also features a cover of lynyrd skynyrd's simple man, from there shinedown spent a lot of time touring, most of what they do infact is tour, several of there albums where written on tour, currently released they have leave a whisper (2001), us and them (2005) sound of maddness (2008), somewhere in the stratosphere aka there live album (2011), amaryllis (2012) and threat to survival (2015) durring this time they have had other projects, like an EP, Itunes session, warner sound live room, studio album collection, and accustic sessions in 2014 with lead singer and guitarest brent smith and zach myres where they did accustic covers to songs, Zach Myers is the lead guitarest for shinedown, music apears to be a big part of his life, he works in and with several bands and is a father as of 2016, as someone who has seen him live I can testify he is an amazing guitarest that can play music very well Barry Kerch is the drummer, the only information i can find about him is he is married and was born in Jacksonville Florida, his hair is normally in dreadlocks that flail around when he plays (i've seen it), Eric Bass is the band's current bass/piano player, not much is out there about him from what I can find sadly, however it is said he had a passion for music, finally we have brent smith, he started shinedown in 2001 after his previous band failed, he is an amazing singer who could (likely) sing anything and I will love it! Brent had a drug and alchohol adiction for a while, though with motivation from his girlfriend and new-born son helped him gain the motivation to kick the aiction and his depresion,

this is my favorite band of all time, first and foremost reason I LOVE rock & roll it's my favorite genre of music but that's a topic for another time, the real reason for my vast love of this band has to do a lot with my uncle in fact, my uncle's job requies a lot of traveling and one time when he was in another state on work he was listining to the radio in the rental car,
